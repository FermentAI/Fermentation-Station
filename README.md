# Fermentation Station
Here's an interactive teaching tool to see how the fermentation process looks on a large scale. You can make predictions of fermentation outputs based on online measurements.
Check to see if your system's environment controls are working and test the efficiency of your machine.

## Use cases:
- something something
- Meet Mary. Mary is an upstream process developer at FermentAI trying to optimize bioproduction of silk to be used for sustainable textile products. She believes that a better cooling system will improve overall protein yields, but needs to convince upper maganment to make the investment. To explain the process to non-engineers, she decides to run simulations in the Fermenation Station. She uses the default penicilin fermentation model, but generalizes the simulations results to her specific use case in silk production. With a few clicks, she varies the cooling water flow rate and temperature, and introduces distrubances to simulate faulty equipment. She then generates protein yield curves for the different conditions, showing the importance of temperature control throughout the fermentation process. Upper managment can clearly see the performance improvement and decides to invest in a new cooling system for Mary.

- Sally is a senior fermentation engineer at FermentAI. Her intern has just told her about Fermentation Station, and now she's trying to develop new models for their specific processes. Thankfully, Fermenation Station is capable of loading custom bioreactor models and offer the same visualization and analysis capabalities. Sally is able to customize the Fermentation Station and distriubute among her colleagues.
